# Bank Note Authentication
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

Whenever you go to the bank to deposit some cash, the cashier places banknotes in a machine that tells whether a banknote is genuine or counterfeit. The machine uses some classification techniques to do it. We will be using RandomForestClassifier to classify between genuine and counterfeit bank notes.
